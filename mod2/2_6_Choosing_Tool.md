## Steps for Implementing App Monitoring

1. Identify monitoring goals
    - Determine aspects of app that require monitoring
    - Specific relevant metrics
2. Choose a monitoring tool
    - Open source or commercial
3. Define key metrics
4. Instrumentation
    - Write and execute code to track defined metrics
    - Simplify by leveraging available libraries and existing frameworks
5. Set up alerts
6. Data storage and visualization
    - Consider standard options such as:
        - DBs
        - TSDBs
        - Dashboards with real-time insights
7. Test and validate
